    <h1>Hobbies list</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Love reading books</h2>
    <p>I love reading fantasy and mystery thriller books. I prefer reading ebooks compared to physical books. It's accessible and more convenient to read.</p>
    <h2>Playing the piano</h2>
    <p>I love music and playing the piano allows me to play my own interpretation of my favourite music. Currently I'm learning to play the classic disney musical piece, "A whole new world".</p>
    <h2>Reading comics or manhwas</h2>
    <p>Exploring new art styles and reading stories in the form of images are exciting and fresh. I love reading romcom manhwas whenever I need a distraction from the world.</p>
    <h2>Watching kdramas, jdramas and cdramas</h2>
    <p>It is interesting to learn new cultures and languages. I find media to be a source of knowledge in understanding these two aspects. I tend to grasp certain segments of these languages which has helped me to understand japanese, korean and chinese.</p>
